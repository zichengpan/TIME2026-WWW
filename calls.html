    <h2>Author Guidelines</h2>

    <h3>Formatting Requirements</h3>
    <p>Submissions must be written in English, in double-column format, and must adhere to the ACM template and format (also available in <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>). Word users may use the <a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/word_style/interim-template.docx">Word Interim Template</a>.</p>
    <p>The recommended setting for LaTeX is:</p>
    <pre style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 4px; overflow-x: auto;">\documentclass[sigconf, review]{acmart}</pre>
    <p>Submission must be as a single PDF file. Papers may range from 4 to 8 pages in length, with authors permitted to include additional pages exclusively for references and appendices. There is no distinction between long and short papers; authors can select the length that best suits their work.</p>

    <h3>Double-Blind Review Policy</h3>
    <p>Paper submissions must conform to the double-blind review policy, meaning that authors should omit their names and affiliations from the paper. This ensures a fair and unbiased evaluation of all submissions. All papers will be peer-reviewed by experts in the field. Acceptance will be based on relevance to the workshop, scientific novelty, and technical quality.</p>

    <h3>AI-Generated Content Disclosure</h3>
    <p>As part of the submission process, please ensure that your work adheres to ethical standards regarding AI-generated content. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Disclosure Required:</strong> Authors are required to disclose any use of tools such as ChatGPT or other AI-based systems in the creation of the paper. This includes usage for generating text, analysis, or other content.</li>
      <li><strong>Proper Attribution:</strong> If AI tools are used in the paper preparation, authors must ensure that proper attribution is provided and that the tool is used ethically.</li>
      <li><strong>AI as Authors:</strong> AI tools should not be listed as authors. Only human contributors should be credited as authors. Please ensure that all contributors meet the ACM Publications Policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Submission and Review Process</h3>
    <p>TIME 2026 will be using OpenReview to manage submissions. Submissions under review will be visible only to their assigned members of the program committee (area chairs and reviewers). The reviews and author responses will be made public.</p>

    <h3>OpenReview Profile Completion</h3>
    <p>Anyone who plans to submit a paper as an author or a co-author will need to create (or update) their OpenReview profile by the paper submission deadline. Complete OpenReview profiles are required for better assignment and conflict detection. Papers with authors who have not completed their profiles will be desk-rejected.</p>

    <h3>Exceptions and Accommodations</h3>
    <p>Deadlines and policies will be strictly enforced. There will be no exceptions or accommodations for late submissions, misconfigured author or co-author accounts on OpenReview, and/or changes to the author lists after the paper submission deadline.</p>

    <h3>Publication</h3>
    <p>Papers accepted by TIME 2026 workshop will be included in the Companion Proceedings of The Web Conference (WWW 2026), subject to meeting the camera-ready timeline. Accepted papers from the previous edition of TIME workshop were published in the Companion Proceedings of WWW 2025.</p>
