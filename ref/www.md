## Description

The ACM Web Conference (formerly the International World Wide Web Conference, or WWW) has been the leading annual venue for exploring the future of the World Wide Web since its inception in 1989. As the premier forum for presenting advances in Web technologies, the conference brings together researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and users to discuss and shape the Web’s future direction.

Over the past three decades, The Web Conference has introduced some of the most fundamental Web innovations, such as the Anatomy of a Large-Scale Web Search Engine in 1998 (prefiguring Google), the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003, and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007. The conference continues to foster collaboration and innovation across academia and industry, addressing cutting-edge research, applications, and societal impacts of the Web.

The 2025 ACM Web Conference will be held in Sydney, Australia, offering a hybrid format with both in-person sessions and rich virtual components. The program will include keynotes, research presentations, panels, workshops, tutorials, and opportunities for developers and junior scholars to engage with the Web community. Live streaming and pre-recorded talks will ensure global accessibility, while the Whova platform will facilitate interactive networking among participants worldwide.

## TIME 2025 at WWW25
TIME 2025 at WWW25 is a natural fit for The Web Conference, aligning seamlessly with its mission to advance interdisciplinary research and foster impactful innovation in web technologies. The workshop emphasizes the dynamic interplay between technology, innovation, and multidisciplinary exploration, addressing technical and societal challenges in the evolving web landscape. By bringing together experts from diverse fields—such as social network analysis, graph algorithms, web content analysis, security, privacy, fairness, and ethics—the workshop exemplifies WWW’s commitment to groundbreaking research that is responsibly aligned with societal needs.

The relevance of this workshop is more critical than ever, as web technologies increasingly influence diverse sectors, including social media, healthcare, and e-commerce, each grappling with unique yet interconnected challenges. For example, privacy practices developed in healthcare can inform data security in social networks, while fairness standards in content moderation for social media can inspire transparency frameworks for e-commerce algorithms. TIME 2025 promotes such cross-domain adaptability, bridging the divide between academic research and industry demands to develop innovative and practical solutions.

The workshop’s collaborative structure is designed to address these challenges head-on, fostering participation through practical guidance, comprehensive evaluations, and concise survey papers. This inclusive format ensures accessibility for both seasoned experts and newcomers, encouraging broad engagement from researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. By facilitating this type of interdisciplinary exchange, TIME 2025 supports the development of robust, responsible web technologies while cultivating a knowledge base that prioritizes ethical, transparent, and secure principles.

Aligned with The Web Conference’s mission, TIME 2025 promises to provide attendees with actionable insights, cutting-edge methodologies, and innovative frameworks to enhance the impact and relevance of their work across multiple domains. It represents a pivotal step forward in addressing the interconnected challenges of today’s web and shaping its future responsibly.
