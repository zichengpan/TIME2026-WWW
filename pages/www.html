          The ACM Web Conference (formerly the International World Wide Web Conference, or WWW) has been the leading annual venue for exploring the future of the World Wide Web since its inception in 1989.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the premier forum for presenting advances in Web technologies, the conference brings together researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and users to discuss and shape the Web's future direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past three decades, The Web Conference has introduced some of the most fundamental Web innovations, such as the Anatomy of a Large-Scale Web Search Engine in 1998 (prefiguring Google), the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003, and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007. The conference continues to foster collaboration and innovation across academia and industry, addressing cutting-edge research, applications, and societal impacts of the Web.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 2026 ACM Web Conference will be held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, offering a hybrid format with both in-person sessions and rich virtual components. The program will include keynotes, research presentations, panels, workshops, tutorials, and opportunities for developers and junior scholars to engage with the Web community.
